               <p class="A1">Blood donation is when a person voluntarily donates their blood to be used for transfusions or to make biopharmaceutical medications. The blood can be donated as whole blood or as specific components, such as plasma, red cells, or platelets.
                You must be in good health at the time you donate. You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection. If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure. .</p>

                <p>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole blood components). A donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.</p>

                <p class="d3-q1ans">We’ll cleanse an area on your arm and insert a new sterile needle for the blood draw. (This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.)</p><br>
                <p>A whole blood donation takes about 8-10 minutes, during which you’ll be seated comfortably or lying down while approximately a pint of whole blood is collected.</p><br>
                <p>For a Power Red donation, a device will use a single-use kit to collect two units of packed red blood cells and return your plasma along with saline through the same sterile needle in approximately 45 minutes.</p><br>
                <p>For plasma, a device will use a single-use kit to collect plasma and return your red cells and platelets along with saline through the same sterile needle in approximately 45 minutes</p><br>
                <p>For platelets, a device will use a single-use kit to collect the platelets and a small amount of plasma and return the rest of your blood through a sterile needle in your other arm in approximately two hours.</p><br>
                <p>When your donation is complete, a staff person will place a bandage on your arm and provide post donation instructions.</p>
